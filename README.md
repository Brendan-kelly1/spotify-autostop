# spotify-autostop
Simple bash utility to stop Spotify playing after certain time elapsed

> This script works only in *macOS* since it uses AppleScript under the hood

# Usage

Open terminal: 
```bash
$ chmod +x /path/to/spotify-autostop
$ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/spotify-autostop-directory

# now you can run the script like this or just double click on file in Finder
